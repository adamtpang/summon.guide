## 📊 Unit Economics
- Chat-only: $0.01/msg cost, $0.10/msg revenue = **89.5% margin**
- Voice: ~$0.17/msg cost = money loser at $10/100. Gate as premium.
- $10/100 text messages = sweet spot for v1
- Voice should be opt-in or premium tier

## 📡 Distribution Strategy (ranked)
1. TikTok/Reels: wisdom clips with watermark → viral → free
2. SEO: "rockefeller advice on money" → own the long-tail
3. X/Twitter: wisdom cards → every conversation = distribution
4. Referral loop: "give a friend 5 msgs, get 5 yourself"
5. NS.com beta testing: in-person demos
6. Paid ads: Facebook/Instagram after unit economics proven
